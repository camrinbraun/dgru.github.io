  <h6>Identifying differential resource utilization between two closely related species</h6>

<div class="row">

The vast diversity of the phytoplankton has long perplexed biological oceanographers, as these organisms superficially appear to coexist in an isotropic environment while competing for the same basic resources: nutrients and light. Partitioning of resources has been hypothesized to be one factor enabling the “paradox of the plankton,” but quantitative approaches to identify and track it in the field have been lacking. Sequencing approaches such as metatranscriptome profiling enable species-specific metabolic profiles to be tracked within a complex, mixed assemblage. Using this approach enabled the direct examination of the ecophysiology of specific species <i>in situ</i>. Additionally, the development of a novel metatranscriptome pipeline enabled further comparisons between species by using these data to 1) identify novel resource responsive gene targets without a priori knowledge of function and 2) contextualize expression signals to compare the ecophysiology of organisms.

The low nutrient, oligotrophic subtropical gyres cover such vast regions of the planet that they are central to global carbon cycling. In these low productivity systems, injection of nutrient rich water has been found to stimulate the typically dilute eukaryotic photosynthetic plankton (phytoplankton), specifically diatoms, that then form large, productive blooms. These diatom blooms cause dramatic increases in primary production and carbon export to the deep sea. Despite their critical importance, little is known about what causes these blooms or the metabolic traits that favor blooms of diatoms over other functional groups of phytoplankton.
Molecular assessment of biogeochemical constraints on primary production and metabolic profiling in oligotrophic waters has been largely limited to the dominant prokaryotic organisms with groundbreaking studies illuminating diel synchrony (Ottesen et al., Science, 2014) and multiple nutrient stressors (Saito et al., Science, 2014). Recently, molecular surveys have greatly expanded our understanding of biogeography and diversity with in the eukaryotes (TARA Oceans), yet process studies that focus on expressed metabolism are lacking. Here we developed and applied a novel metatranscriptomic approach (Alexander et al., PNAS, 2015) to quantitatively resolve taxon-specific physiology and metabolic traits in the rare eukaryotic phytoplankton population with unprecedented resolution. By tracking in situ patterns over time in the oligotrophic North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and comparing them to simulated blooms we demonstrate that nutrients, metals and vitamins, variably limit the production of eukaryotic phytoplankton functional groups – highlighting the importance of co-limitation to the diatom functional group.
