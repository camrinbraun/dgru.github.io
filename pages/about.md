Camrin is fascinated by fish, and a childhood obsession with fresh and saltwater fishing has manifested itself into a career. In 2010, he joined a team of experts who employ cutting edge tagging technologies to understand the ecology of the world’s most important fishes. Since, he has been elected a National Geographic Young Explorer and been inducted into the Explorer’s Club. His expeditions have ranged from sailing the remote Pacific to understand coral reefs to tagging sharks in Sudan. In 2012, Camrin moved to Saudi Arabia to pursue a master’s degree in marine science where he used animal tagging to study manta rays in the Red Sea. He is now pursuing his PhD in the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography where he explores the relationship between the movements of pelagic fishes and their ocean environment. He hopes this work will directly improve management of these important fish populations and keep them in our ocean for future generations to enjoy.
