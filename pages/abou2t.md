My current research focuses on understanding the biogeochemical functioning and physiological ecology of eukaryotic phytoplankton in a changing ocean. In particular, I am interested in the maintenance of genetic diversity in these populations and the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning. I use a combination of culture- and field-based experiments and 'omic techniques to address these questions.<br>
More generally, I am interested in open science, management and better utilization (and sharing) of large data sets, and the improvment computational tools and resources for sceintists. Along these lines, I am a instructor for <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>.
